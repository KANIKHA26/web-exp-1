            <p><pre>     <b>Chandrayaan-3</b> i    s India's u  pcoming lunar exploration mission, designed to further expand the country's scientific knowledge about the Moon. Serving as a follow-up to Chandrayaan-2, this mission aims to achieve a successful soft landing on the lunar surface. Unlike its predecessor, Chandrayaan-3 will consist solely of a lander and a rover, omitting the orbiter component. The lander-rover combination will carry scientific instruments to study the Moon's composition, geology, and surface characteristics, providing valuable insights into its history and evolution. This mission underscores India's commitment to space exploration and technological advancement, fostering international collaboration and pushing the boundaries of lunar research. By focusing on a successful landing and enhancing the rover's capabilities, Chandrayaan-3 endeavors to contribute significantly to humanity's understanding of the Moon's mysteries and inspire future lunar missions </p>   <!-- comenting-->
            <p>The <i> primary </i> objectives of Chandrayaan-2 are to study the distribution of elements and minerals on the Moon's surface, examine the presence of water ice in the polar regions, and investigate the origin and evolution of the Moon's geology. These objectives have the potential to provide insights into the early solar system's conditions and the Moon's history.</pre></p>
            <p>The orbiter plays a crucial role in Chandrayaan-2's mission. It is equipped with a suite of scientific instruments to study the Moon from orbit. These instruments include a Terrain Mapping Camera-2 (TMC-2) for generating high-resolution 3D maps, a Dual Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (DFSAR) for studying the Moon's surface and subsurface, and a Large Area Soft X-ray Spectrometer (CLASS) for analyzing the elemental composition of the lunar surface.</p>
            <p>Vikram, the lander, was designed to perform a controlled descent and make a soft landing near the Moon's south pole. It carried within it the Pragyan rover. The lander housed scientific instruments to measure seismic activity on the Moon, study its thermal properties, and assess the presence of water ice in the soil. It was also equipped with a camera to capture images of the lunar surface.</p>
            <p>Pragyan, the rover, was designed to explore the Moon's surface and conduct scientific experiments. It was equipped with instruments like an Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) to analyze elemental composition, a Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) for identifying minerals, and a camera system for capturing images. The rover had the capability to move around the landing site and gather data from various locations</p>
            
            <p title='abc' >As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Chandrayaan-3 had not been officially announced or detailed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Therefore, I can provide information based on the status up until that point. Please note that there might have been developments or announcements after September 2021 that I am not aware of.</p>
            <p>Chandrayaan-3, if it follows a similar trajectory to its predecessors Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2, would be India's third lunar exploration mission. The Chandrayaan series aims to advance our understanding of the Moon's surface, geology, and composition, while also exploring the potential for resources and future human exploration.Chandrayaan-1, launched in 2008, was India's first lunar probe. It successfully discovered water molecules on the lunar surface, challenging the earlier assumption that </p>

            <p> <em> However</em>, <mark> during</mark> the final stages of its descent on September 6, 2019, Vikram lost communication with mission <br> control, leading to an unsuccessful landing attempt. Despite this setback, the orbiter component of Chandrayaan-2 continued to operate successfully and has been sending back valuable data to ISRO.The Chandrayaan-2 mission holds immense significance for India's space exploration endeavors. It showcases the country's technological prowess in areas such as launch vehicles, navigation, and deep space communication. It also underscores ISRO's commitment to conducting cost-effective and innovative space missions. The mission's scientific objectives align with global efforts to better understand the Moon's composition, geology, and potential as a stepping stone for future human exploration.Chandrayaan-2 is a stepping stone for India's lunar exploration journey, with plans for future missions including Chandrayaan-3, which is aimed at achieving a successful soft landing on the lunar surface.
